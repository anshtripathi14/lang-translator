# Live Preview: https://live-translator.netlify.app

## Overview
The **Real-Time Language Translator** is a web-based application that enables users to translate text between multiple languages in real time. The project leverages the Google Translate API for text translation and integrates speech recognition, text-to-speech, and optical character recognition (OCR) for enhanced usability.

## Features
- **Multi-Language Translation**: Supports translation between English, Hindi, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, and Arabic.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts translated text into speech using the browser's speech synthesis API.
- **Speech Recognition (Voice-to-Text)**: Allows users to input text via voice commands.
- **Voice-to-Voice Translation**: Translates spoken input and plays back the translated output.
- **Image-to-Text Translation (OCR)**: Extracts text from images and translates it.
- **Swap Languages**: Quickly swap between source and target languages.
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: Switch between dark and light themes for better user experience.
- **Reset Functionality**: Clears all inputs and outputs.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Core web technologies for UI and interactivity.
- **Google Translate API**: Used for real-time translation.
- **Web Speech API**: Utilized for speech recognition and text-to-speech functionality.
- **Tesseract.js**: OCR library used for image-to-text conversion.
